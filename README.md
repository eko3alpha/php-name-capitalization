Proper human name capitalization

I was looking for a php script that could handle proper capitalization of names. While I realize that it would be difficult to handle 100% of cases

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_family_name_affixes

I think this script does a pretty good job handling 95% of use cases. It's certainly a great starting point.

Here is where I found the script.

Please feel free to enhance this script
